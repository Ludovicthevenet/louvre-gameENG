                <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, explorers of the invisible, riddle-seekers, and curious souls,</p>
                <p>Tonight, the doors of the Louvre open not only to art and history, but to an ancestral secret, woven into the vibrant shades of the masterpieces surrounding us. Forget tourist guides and marked paths for a moment. For today, you are invited to a journey of initiation—a quest where observation, insight, and teamwork will be your only compasses.</p>
                <p>For centuries, the Louvre has fiercely guarded clues—silent messages hidden in plain sight, waiting to be deciphered by minds bold enough to see beyond pigments and marbles. These clues, these keys to knowledge, reside in the most fundamental of artistic expressions: <strong>color</strong>.</p>
                <p>Each work, from the humblest ancient artifact to the monumental Renaissance painting, holds a part of this great chromatic mystery. You must not only admire, but <strong>decipher</strong>. Each riddle will guide you to a specific work, in the most fascinating corners of this palace of kings and artists. But make no mistake: fame does not guarantee truth; sometimes, the greatest secrets hide in the shadows of anonymous glories.</p>
                <p>Your mission will be twofold:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uncover the shade</strong>: Identify the exact color, the tone, or the brilliance being asked of you, like a secret code revealed by the artist's palette.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unlock the "Open Sesame"</strong>: Reveal a hidden "password"—a crucial detail that will only appear to the most attentive eyes, a fragment of truth that proves your passage and your understanding.</li>
                </ul>
               <p>This is no ordinary visit; it is a dive into the heart of the enigma, a hunt where every shadow, every light, and every brushstroke may hold the key to the next secret. Time is of the essence, minds are sharpening... and the Louvre awaits your discoveries.</p>
                <p>Let your quest begin, and may the light of colors guide your way!</p>
